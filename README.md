## CT417: Software Engineering III
* Name: _Fill up your name here_
* Student Id: _Fill you your Student-Id_

This is a repository for CT417 assignment. You will find a simple TimeTableApp for you to use in your CI/CD pipeline. Like all great trilogy (Star Wars I – VI :+1:, yes I – III are counted as canon, but never VII – IX :-1:), this assignment will be performed in various sub-parts. 

* ~~Version Control - Setup your project with Git / GitHub~~ 
* ***Build Tools - Develop using Maven (Eclipse IDE)***
* Integrate - Travis CI / Jenkins for CI/CD integration

(Each 10 marks)

### TimeTableApp
This is a basic Java application to manage and display student, lecturer, and module information. It can assist in organizing and presenting course-related details. The application will be able to perform scheduling (semi-automatic) -- helping the university to create and manage class schedules, allocate lecturers to modules, and assign students to specific classes. You have the `Student`, `Lecturer`, `Module`, and `Schedular` classes pre-built in the source.

#### AS02: What you need to do?  
It’s time for part II, the sequel to our successful completion of AS01. In order to track your progress (i.e., mastery of CI/CD pipeline), we will have to increase the difficulty level of your assignment accordingly. Next up, you have to “convert” your basic Java Project to a Maven Java Project. Prep your repository for unit testing (using JUnit 5), write some simple unit tests, and initiate a pull request to merge your updates to your remote repository.

❗Do remember that the deadline for this task will be on the 22nd of October 2023 (00:00)
